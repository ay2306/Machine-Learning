Projects on Machine Learning
1. Digit Recogniser


#### Digit Recogniser

- What it does?
  Sample data has been downloaded from Kaggle, which is pixel values of images of hand-written numbers.
  Using training data, it creates a model to further check data. We checked data with test data and it was found to be 90+% accurate
- Libraries Used:
  1. SciPy kit (for machine learning algorithms)
  2. Numpy (for mathematical operations)
  3. Pandas (for data handling)
  4. Matplotlib (for data visualisation)
